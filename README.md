# new-help-with-app-to-increase-charity-donations-replacing-centralised-justgiving-
I've written a white paper where fundraisers involved in sports activities could utilise the volatility of the cyrpto market. I used to open source code to create the coin but because it hasn't synced then there has been no confirmations. My white paper is being presented to the Â£39 billion charity sector. I hope to trial it. I need the coin to be linked to the 'big' cyrpto currcencies to so that donationtions are increased via a decentralised model of fundraising rather than 'justgiving' or the equivalent. Sorry if this is the wrong board to post this. My white paper explains it all fully. But the gist is that donations to charity through participation in sports/exercise related activities would be increased via a decentralised ethereum based app. Thanks for any help, or at least point me in the right direction.
